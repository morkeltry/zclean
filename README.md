## Concept

### Goal

Making a very rough reimplementation of zero-cash like, adding a feature that coins are tainted (with a bit), and that while transferring in zero-knowledge we also prove that the taint is preserved. We only do shielded transactions, and everything has value 1.
The state of the blockchain is a merkle tree containing commitements and a list of nullifier.

### Components to the blockchain peer + wallet:

- JSON API
- MT server
- Snarky Circuit
- the blockchain, on a Redis list
- a wallet with the secrets necessary for the peer to spend the notes
- a config with the port list

### Adding a block(transferring something):

- I want to transfer a note, I ask my peer to spend it by giving him the neccessary witness informations (aka I use my client, similar to using a full bitcoin node as a wallet) and he creates his own committement.
- it generates the necessary ZKproofs
- sends that to the receiver peer
- the receiver verify all proofs and
  - if successful broadcast it to the network
  - else do nothing/reject
- if it's accepted, the blockchain is now one block larger


###Â Rules

- start with a mktree, containing commitement of the type H(r,b).
- utxo with 1 in 1 out, no values(or v = 1)
- to transfer, share a zk with the person you are transferring proving that you know the preimage
- the nulifier is stored in a dead drop style(file, for now, could be anything, as long as it has the potential to be replaced by an anonymous system)


### Block Content:

- root
- nullifier
- new cm
- proof1: nf is computed correctly
- proof2: old cm existed in the tree corresponding to root
- proof3: the flag is consistent (b_old = b_new)

### Prover file content:
Prover file `transfer_secrets` takes a lines of unlabelled values (some are tuples):

*  *r* - our secret with which to spend this commitment
*  *v* - the value of the spent commitment (1)
*  *flag* - the 'clean' flags of the spent commitment, eg 1 or 1155 ( =3*5*7*11 )
*  *l1_sibling* - a tuple of the field value of the sibling of the ancestor on the first level of the Merkel tree, along with the direction in the tree of this value (true/false), eg 34567890098765434567,false
*  *l2_sibling* - " " second level below root
*  *l3_sibling* - " " third level below root, ie the sibling of our commitment
*  *r'* - secret to attach to new commitment
*  *v'* - the value of the new commitment (1)
*  *flag'* - the 'clean' flags of the new commitment, should be same as old one, eg 1 or 1155 ( =3*5*7*11 )

The discards flag does not work in the current version of snarky and will cause a `Match_failure` exception due to unexpected file length
*  *discards* - always 1 in the case that the same flags are carried through


#### NB:
on first run, `snarky_cli generate-keys create-coin-commitment.zk --curve Bn128` gives error:
```
File "create-coin-commitment_gen.ml", line 4, characters 24-53:
Error: Signature mismatch:
       ...
       In module R1CS_constraint_system:
       Values do not match:
         val digest : t -> Core.Md5.t
       is not included in
         val digest : t -> Core_kernel.Md5.t
       File "src/backend_intf.ml", line 91, characters 4-27:
         Expected declaration
       File "src/libsnark.ml", line 945, characters 4-27: Actual declaration
```
Don't worry - run it again.

### Requirements:

- Docker(to run the blockchain datastore. redis ATM)
- Ocaml via opam, switched to 4.07.1
- Snarky installed (good luck with that :D)
- node.js 12 to run the client and the peer

### Starting a demo env

- run `./install.sh`
- `docker-compose up` to start the redis instances
- open 6 term windows
- in 3 of them, run `./startPeer.sh 0, 1 and 2`
- in 3 of them, run `./startWallet.sh 0, 1 and 2`
- in 1 of them, run `./startExplorer.sh` for the block explorer

Usage of the wallet:

- to transfer a coin, type `t 0/1` in a wallet to transfer one coin to a peer
- to get the balance, type `b`
- to check the status, type `s`
